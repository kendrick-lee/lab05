I think that the secret_forumla file is taking an array of numbers the using the function secret_formula_apply to make the array into a 
different set of number that is a secret code. Then after the file will take those numbers that are encrypted and then use the secret 
formula remove to take the encryption off the numbers and reveal the original array.

i)Yes, u[i]*t[i] = secret_formula_remove(c[i]*f[i]) for all entries hold true. In array forms they end up both being [0x15, 0x0f, 0x15] or [21,15,21].

ii)Yes, u[i]*t[i] = secret_formula_remove(c[i]*f[i]) for all entries hold true. In array forms they end up both being [0x0A, 0x08, 0x16] or [10, 8, 22].
